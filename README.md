Sound synthesis tutorials

ST – Synthesis Tutorials – comprises a set of four basic models of sound synthesis, created as an educational tool for my classes of Sound Synthesis and Musical Programming, at ESART-IPCB.
The current version implements Additive, Subtractive, Ring Modulation/Classic AM, and Frequency Modulation.
ST was developed in MaxMSP.
